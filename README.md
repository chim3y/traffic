# Traffic prediction and time-spent estimation in toll booths

## Introduction
This project aims to identify how traffic behaves in Buenos Aires' highways, in order to predict how it will behave in the future. In particular, the traffic patterns to be analyzed are those that happen in toll booths, distributed all along the perimeter of the city, making emphasis on the queues and traffic congestions that happen during peak hours.

## Areas of study
The analysis is divided into two sections:
- An initial [descriptive analysis](https://github.com/tulians/traffic/blob/master/descriptive/README.md) of the traffic behaviours. This analysis covers everything between traffic volume distribution per hour and day, distribution of infractions per vehicle type, how drivers moved from paying with cash to using automatic tolls, and lastly a [forescast of traffic volume per day](https://github.com/tulians/traffic/blob/master/descriptive/README.md#analyzing-traffic-as-a-time-series-and-forecasting-future-traffic).
- Building on top of the previous point, a study of time-spent on toll booth queues is detailed on [the second analysis](https://github.com/tulians/traffic/blob/master/time-estimation/README.md). This analysis is perfomed using queueing theory, and aims to provide insights on what would be the optimal amount of active toll booths in each toll booth plaza at each moment of time, thus reducing time-spent in traffic for drivers.
